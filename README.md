# Monkey Interpreter (in Go)

This repository contains my implementation of a simple interpreter for the Monkey programming language, based on the excellent book ["Writing An Interpreter In Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.

The project is an educational exploration into building an interpreter from scratch in Go, following the book's step-by-step guide to parsing, evaluating, and executing code in a custom programming language.

## Features

- Lexical analysis (lexer)
- Parsing into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- A REPL for interactive use
- Evaluation of expressions and statements
- First-class functions and closures
- Built-in data types: integers, booleans, strings, arrays, and hashes
- Error handling
